# Applied-Machine-Learning-course

Welcome to my Applied Machine Learning coursework repository, completed as part of my M.S. in Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University. This repository contains a structured and well-documented collection of assignments covering a broad spectrum of machine learning topics and real-world applications.

Each module is organized into its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` summarizing objectives, tasks, models used, and implementation highlights.
