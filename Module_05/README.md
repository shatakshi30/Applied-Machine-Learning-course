# Module 05: Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Supervised Classification

### Assignment Summary
This assignment focused on building an end-to-end classification pipeline using the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle. The objective was to predict passenger survival based on various features, preprocess the dataset effectively, and submit results to Kaggle for evaluation.

### Tasks Covered
- Downloaded and loaded Titanic training (891 rows) and testing (418 rows) datasets.
- Handled **missing values** for features like `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked` through imputation and transformation.
- Performed **feature selection** and removal of irrelevant or redundant columns (e.g., `PassengerId`, `Ticket`, `Name`).
- Applied **encoding techniques** for categorical variables such as `Sex` and `Embarked`.
- Built a classification model using **Random Forest**, selected for its robustness with structured/tabular data.
- Tuned model parameters and cross-validated performance on training data.
- Exported predictions for the test dataset in a Kaggle-compatible format.

### Highlights
- Achieved a submission accuracy of **X%** on Kaggle (replace this with your actual score).
- Observed that features like `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, and `Fare` were most predictive of survival.
- Demonstrated understanding of real-world model deployment and leaderboard-based evaluation through Kaggle submission.
